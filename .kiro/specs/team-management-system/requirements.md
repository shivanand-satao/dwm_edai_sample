# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Team Management System that enables managers to organize teams, assign tasks, and track daily work progress. The system supports multiple independent teams with role-based access control and is designed to collect structured data for future AI-powered analytics on employee productivity and work patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management and Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and authenticate with role-based access, so that I can access appropriate features based on my role (manager or employee).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager registers THEN the system SHALL generate a unique manager ID for team identification
2. WHEN an employee registers THEN the system SHALL require a manager ID to join the appropriate team
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and provide role-based access
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2: Team Structure Management

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to create and manage my team using a unique team identifier, so that employees can join my team and I can organize work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager registers THEN the system SHALL create a unique team with the manager as team lead
2. WHEN an employee uses a manager ID THEN the system SHALL add them to the corresponding team
3. WHEN viewing team members THEN the system SHALL display only users belonging to the authenticated manager's team
4. IF an invalid manager ID is used THEN the system SHALL reject the team join request
5. WHEN a team is created THEN the system SHALL establish proper data isolation between teams

### Requirement 3: Task Assignment and Management

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to assign tasks to my team members with due dates, so that I can distribute work and track completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager creates a task THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to any team member with a due date
2. WHEN a task is assigned THEN the system SHALL notify the assigned employee
3. WHEN viewing tasks THEN managers SHALL see all team tasks and employees SHALL see only their assigned tasks
4. WHEN a task approaches due date THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate notifications
5. IF a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL mark it with overdue status

### Requirement 4: Proof Submission and Task Completion

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to submit proof of task completion before the due date, so that I can demonstrate work completion to my manager.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee completes a task THEN the system SHALL allow uploading proof documents or files
2. WHEN proof is submitted THEN the system SHALL timestamp the submission and mark task as completed
3. WHEN a manager views completed tasks THEN the system SHALL display submitted proof materials
4. IF proof is submitted after due date THEN the system SHALL mark submission as late
5. WHEN proof is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and size limits

### Requirement 5: Daily Work Logging

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to log my daily work activities, so that I can track my productivity and my manager can monitor team progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee logs daily work THEN the system SHALL record work description, date, and time spent
2. WHEN a manager views daily work THEN the system SHALL display all team members' work logs
3. WHEN an employee views daily work THEN the system SHALL display only their own work logs
4. WHEN daily work is logged THEN the system SHALL store structured data for future analysis
5. IF no work is logged for a day THEN the system SHALL indicate missing entries

### Requirement 6: Analytics-Ready Data Structure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want work data stored in a structured format, so that future AI analysis can be performed on productivity patterns and work trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN work data is stored THEN the system SHALL use consistent data formats and categories
2. WHEN tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL record completion metrics and timestamps
3. WHEN daily work is logged THEN the system SHALL capture quantifiable work metrics
4. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL support efficient analytics queries
5. IF data analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL provide clean, normalized data sets

### Requirement 7: Role-Based Data Access

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see only the data I'm authorized to access based on my role, so that team privacy and data security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager accesses data THEN the system SHALL show their own work plus all team members' data
2. WHEN an employee accesses data THEN the system SHALL show only their own work and assigned tasks
3. WHEN cross-team data is requested THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block the request and notify administrators
5. WHEN data is displayed THEN the system SHALL filter results based on user role and team membership

### Requirement 8: Database Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast response times and reliable data storage, so that the application performs well as teams and data volume grow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL respond within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN multiple teams use the system THEN the system SHALL maintain performance across all teams
3. WHEN data volume increases THEN the system SHALL continue to perform efficiently
4. IF database connections fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and retry connections
5. WHEN backup operations run THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and availability
